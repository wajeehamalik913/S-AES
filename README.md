# S-AES

=> g++ S_AES.cpp

=> ./a.out

A small software company S-SOFT needed a small version of AES (S-AES) to meet
their security requirements. For this they have used first five Rounds of AES to
perform Encryption and Decryption on 128-bit blocks data using 128-bit Keys.

The above S-AES code takes message inpute from a file and write the encrypted and 
decrypted message in another file.
